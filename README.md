# ML-Projects-Mart-Sales-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Big Mart Sales Prediction** using the **XGBoost Regressor** algorithm. The model predicts product sales based on features such as **Item Weight, Item Fat Content, Item Visibility, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, and Outlet Type**. Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed, including **weight, visibility, MRP, and sales distributions**, along with analysis of **outlet establishment year** and **fat content** trends. The model achieved an impressive **R² value of 0.87**, demonstrating strong predictive performance. This project showcases ML applications in **retail sales forecasting and inventory planning**.
